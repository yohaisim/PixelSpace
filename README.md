PixelSpace is an exciting retro-style mobile game inspired by the aesthetics and gameplay of the 80s. Embark on a thrilling adventure, navigating your spaceship through a field of obstacles in a fast-paced and immersive experience.

## 🕹️ Gameplay
- Control your spaceship as it moves **horizontally** (left and right) to dodge obstacles.
- You start with **three stars**, and each collision with an obstacle costs you one star.
- The game ends when all stars are lost, but don't worry—your score and rank are automatically updated on the **high scores leaderboard**.

## 🎮 Game Modes
PixelSpace offers three unique gameplay modes to suit your style:
1. **Fast Speed**: For players seeking an adrenaline-filled challenge.
2. **Slow Speed**: A relaxed mode to master your dodging skills.
3. **Sensor Mode**: Use your device's motion sensors to tilt your spaceship left and right for an immersive experience.
